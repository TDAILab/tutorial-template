Ship models faster and do more science!
Our open-source deep learning platform enables you to train models in hours and minutes, not days and weeks.

Focus on research and models
Instead of arduous tasks like manual hyperparameter tuning, re-running faulty jobs, and worrying about hardware resources.

Distributed training as it was meant to be
Our distributed training implementation outperforms the industry standard, requires no code changes, and is fully integrated with our state of the art training platform.

It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`start` the project.
